# Dataset Pre-Splitting Implementation

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

**Before**: Each time `train.py` or `test.py` was run, they created **different random splits** of the data, leading to potential data leakage where the model could be tested on data it was trained on.

**After**: Dataset is split **once** into fixed train/validation/test sets, ensuring consistency across all runs.

## 📁 **Files Created/Modified**

### **Modified Files:**
1. **`utils.py`** - Added dataset splitting functions
2. **`train.py`** - Updated to use pre-defined splits
3. **`test.py`** - Updated to use pre-defined splits

### **New Files:**
1. **`test_splits.py`** - Test script to verify splitting works correctly
2. **`dataset_splits.json`** - Auto-generated file storing split indices

## 🔧 **New Functions in utils.py**

### 1. `create_dataset_splits(config, force_recreate=False)`
- Creates train/val/test splits (80/10/10) with fixed random seed
- Saves split indices to `dataset_splits.json`
- Only recreates if file doesn't exist or `force_recreate=True`
- Filters dataset by sequence length before splitting

### 2. `load_dataset_by_split(config, split_type)`
- Loads specific split: 'train', 'val', or 'test'
- Uses indices from `dataset_splits.json`
- Returns list of dataset items for the specified split

## 📊 **Split Configuration**

```
Total Dataset → Filtered by seq_len → Split into:
├── Train (80%)      - Used for training
├── Validation (10%) - Used for monitoring during training  
└── Test (10%)       - Used for final evaluation
```

## 🚀 **Usage**

### **Training:**
```bash
python train.py  # Automatically uses pre-defined train/val splits
```

### **Testing:**
```bash
python test.py 5 "Test sentence"     # Translation
python test.py 5 --evaluate          # Evaluation on test set
```

### **Verify Splits:**
```bash
python test_splits.py  # Test that splitting works correctly
```

## 📋 **Key Features**

✅ **Consistent Splits**: Same train/val/test split across all runs
✅ **No Data Leakage**: Zero overlap between train/val/test sets
✅ **Reproducible**: Fixed random seed (42) ensures same splits
✅ **Cached**: Splits saved to file, no need to recreate
✅ **Automatic**: First run creates splits, subsequent runs load them
✅ **Configurable**: Easy to change split ratios if needed

## 🔍 **Verification**

The implementation includes several safety checks:
- Verifies no overlap between splits
- Consistent indices across multiple calls
- Proper filtering by sequence length
- Detailed logging of split sizes

## 📝 **Generated Files**

### **dataset_splits.json** (auto-created)
```json
{
  "train_indices": [1, 5, 8, ...],
  "val_indices": [2, 7, 12, ...], 
  "test_indices": [3, 9, 15, ...],
  "total_examples": 150000,
  "train_size": 120000,
  "val_size": 15000, 
  "test_size": 15000,
  "config_used": {
    "seq_len": 150,
    "lang_src": "fi",
    "lang_tgt": "en"
  }
}
```

## ⚡ **Benefits**

1. **No More Data Leakage**: Model can't cheat by seeing test data during training
2. **Reproducible Results**: Same test set every time = comparable results
3. **Proper Evaluation**: Clean separation between train/val/test
4. **Research Standards**: Follows ML best practices for dataset splitting
5. **Kaggle Ready**: Perfect for competition environments where consistency matters

## 🎉 **Next Steps**

With proper dataset splitting implemented, you're now ready for:
1. Adding validation monitoring during training
2. Implementing early stopping
3. Hyperparameter tuning with confidence
4. Publishing reproducible results

The foundation is solid! 🏗️
