Tomlinson ( PSE ). - Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Tomlinson on her excellent report .

In addition , the proposal for a directive on the part of the Directive on the protection of biotechnological inventions , which is a major issue for the patenting of biotechnological inventions , is a very important element of the development of the patent .

I think that the introduction of the euro will be a major step towards the introduction of the euro and the single currency will be a major step forward .
I also welcome the fact that the European Parliament has adopted a resolution on the implementation of the directive on equal opportunities for women and men , and also on the development of women ' s rights .
